For example, excessively long waste transportation routes can have a negative impact on a large share of the population. This is exacerbated by the rapid urbanization happening worldwide and in developing countries. Sustainability issues should be accounted for at every stage of decision making, from strategic to daily operations. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective optimization model to design a cost-effective waste management supply chain, while considering sustainability issues such as land-use and public health impacts. The model is applied to a case study in Pathum Thani (Thailand) to provide managerial insights.},

Four key social choices in any indicator of the burden of disease are carefully reviewed. First, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods of calculating the duration of life lost due to a death at each age are discussed. DALYs use a standard expected-life lost based on model life-table West Level 26. Second, the value of time lived at different ages is captured in DALYs using an exponential function which reflects the dependence of the young and the elderly on adults. Third, the time lived with a disability is made comparable with the time lost due to premature mortality by defining six classes of disability severity. Assigned to each class is a severity weight between 0 and 1. Finally, a three percent discount rate is used in the calculation of DALYs. The formula for calculating DALYs based on these assumptions is provided.},

	abstract = {One of the important issues in the world is the significant growth of waste production, including waste that is not biodegradable in nature. According to the Kerman Municipality, 440 tonnes of municipal waste is collected daily in Kerman consisting of five major parts of paper, plastic, metal, glass, and wet waste. The major problems of municipal solid waste disposal are soil erosion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The most important factors related to recycling are waste sorting and the relevant environmental conditions. This study aims to create a sustainable approach by locating the optimal sites to reduce environmental pollution, decrease costs, and improve the service system to the society. Optimal locations for establishing the collecting and sorting centers in the city are specified by the use of geographic information system software, based on criteria consisting of population density, road network, distance to health centers, distance to disposal center, waste sorting culture, land space, and land cost, which were weighted by an analytical hierarchy process. It was noteworthy that the criterion “waste sorting culture”, which has a foundation in human sciences and sociology, has been considered by experts in this study to be of the highest importance among other criteria at locating sorting centers. Subsequently, using a symmetric capacitated vehicle routing problem, the number and capacity of each vehicle are determined to serve the specified locations according to the economic, social, and environmental constraints.},

	abstract = {Sustainability, the consideration of environmental factors and social aspects, in supply chain management (SCM) has become a highly relevant topic for researchers and practitioners. The application of operations research methods and related models, i.e. formal modeling, for closed-loop SCM and reverse logistics has been effectively reviewed in previously published research. This situation is in contrast to the understanding and review of mathematical models that focus on environmental or social factors in forward supply chains (SC), which has seen less investigation. To evaluate developments and directions of this research area, this paper provides a content analysis of 134 carefully identified papers on quantitative, formal models that address sustainability aspects in the forward SC. It was found that a preponderance of the publications and models appeared in a limited set of six journals, and most were analytically based with a focus on multiple criteria decision making. The tools most often used comprise the analytical hierarchy process or its close relative, the analytical network process, as well as life cycle analysis. Conclusions are drawn showing that numerous possibilities and insights can be gained from expanding the types of tools and factors considered in formal modeling efforts.},

	doi = {10.35629/6734-1006023341},
	abstract = {This research was carried out to calculate the total cost of municipal solid waste disposal in the Emirate of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Waste management in Sharjah is centralized and, disposal fee is believed to be very low. To unveil the waste disposal total financial impact, waste transportation, landfill equipment Carbon footprint and Landfill gases was calculated and added to the total operational cost. For the first time, lost opportunity caused by using the land to dispose waste was quantified and included in the total cost as well. The results showed that current disposal fee covers only 34.5\% of the total cost. It was also concluded that Sharjah will not be able to finance it's future projects to extract landfill gases and provide other maintenance work, required to ensure safe closure for the coming years. The research concluded that Sharjah may have no choice but to excavate the waste from current location and move it to another one due to the urban development pace around landfill area. By implementing the proposed disposal cost method, waste disposal fee increases by the time considering the increase in the land value until the moment land value becomes equivalent to the expenses to remove all the deposited waste and move it to a newly built landfill. The municipal waste disposal fee in Sharjah for 2021 is recommended to be increased from US \$13.61/ton to a minimum of US \$39.77/ton.},

In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},
